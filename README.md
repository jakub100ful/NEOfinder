# NEO Finder
This project is an application made in React Native for a university assignment. It uses NASA's Near Earth Object API to fetch objects with close approaches to Earth by a specific date, such as your date of birth. The application uses Three.js to generate a scaled down model of the asteroids, and lets the user add specific asteroids to their "orbit", where they can view them later, see their next approach date, and compare their size and speed with other asteroids.

NOTE: This application is not ready for deployment. Using this will require you to generate your own NASA API key.
